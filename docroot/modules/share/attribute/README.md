# Attribute API
The purpose of this module is to provide a framework for defining HTML
attributes that can be related to other entities. These attributes can be
applied to any markup in the DOM document, such as the body tag. It also would
serve as a robust back end to modules like menu_link_attributes and
block_attributes.
